# Voter Fraud
Detection and Mitigation! DO NOT USE THIS FOR MALICIOUS PURPOSES!

# Security Assessment Checklist

## 1. Client-Side Vulnerabilities

### Malicious Clients
Examine if the voting client software can be compromised to alter votes or leak sensitive information.

### Authentication Attacks
Test the mechanisms for voter authentication to see if they can be bypassed or manipulated to impersonate other voters.

## 2. Server-Side Vulnerabilities

### Server Penetration
Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the SIV servers. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in the server software or misconfigurations.

### Data Integrity
Check if cast ballots can be altered or deleted once they are stored on the server.

## 3. Network and Infrastructure Attacks

### Data in Motion
Intercept and analyze the data transmitted between the client and server to identify any weaknesses in encryption or data handling.

### Denial of Service (DoS)
Although the challenge specifies avoiding volumetric attacks, look for ways to disrupt the service without overwhelming it with traffic, such as exploiting resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.

## 4. Privacy and Data Collection

### Excessive Data Collection
Investigate if the system collects more personally identifiable information (PII) than necessary or performs platform fingerprinting.

### Vote Privacy
Determine if it is possible to reveal how a specific individual voted or to prove to a third party how one voted without direct observation.

## 5. Cryptographic Weaknesses

### Random Number Generation
Assess the quality of the random number generation used in cryptographic processes.

### Encryption
Evaluate the encryption methods used to protect vote data and other sensitive information.

## 6. Auditability and Transparency

### End-to-End Auditability
Verify if the system provides meaningful ways to audit the entire voting process from ballot casting to final tallying.

### Tamper Detection
Check if there are mechanisms in place to detect and respond to tampering attempts.

## 7. Stealth and Persistence

### Undetected Attacks
Develop methods to hide your attacks from detection, ensuring that any compromises remain unnoticed.

### Persistence
Ensure that any backdoors or malicious modifications you introduce can survive system reboots and updates.

## Ethical Considerations and Reporting

While participating in the challenge, it is crucial to adhere to ethical hacking guidelines:

### Do Not Cause Harm
Avoid actions that could cause real damage to the system or data.
